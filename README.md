# INE5405 - Probability and Statistics

Welcome to my repository for **INE5405 - Probability and Statistics**, a course I'm taking at the **Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC)** in the **2nd semester of 2024**. This repository contains my work, notes, and projects related to the course.

## Course Overview

**Course Code:** INE5405

**Classes:** 05208A, 05222

**Credit Hours:** 90 hours (45 theoretical, 45 practical)

**Instructors:**

- Prof. Jose Francisco Danilo de Guadalupe Correa Fletes - jose.fletes@ufsc.br
- Prof. Simone Silmara Werner - simone.werner@ufsc.br

## Repository Purpose

This repository is a collection of my personal work for the course, including:

- Assignments
- Project files
- Notes and summaries
- Code examples and exercises

It serves as a way to document my learning process and share my progress throughout the semester.

## Course Content

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Concepts, frequency distribution, measures of location, dispersion, skewness, and presentation of results.
2. **Probability** - Random experiments, sample spaces, events, combinatorial analysis, conditional probability, independence, and Bayes' theorem.
3. **Discrete Random Variables** - Probability functions, expected value, variance, and distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson).
4. **Continuous Random Variables** - Density functions, distribution functions, expected value, variance, and distributions (Exponential, Normal).
5. **Sample Distributions and Parameter Estimation** - Parameters, statistics, sample distributions, estimation of means and proportions, sampling.
6. **Hypothesis Testing** - Hypotheses formulation, types of errors, decision rules, tests for one mean, and difference of means.
7. **Correlation and Regression** - Scatter plots, Pearson correlation coefficient, and regression equations.

## Chosen Database

For my projects and assignments, I will use the dataset available on the [Portal da TransparÃªncia](https://portaldatransparencia.gov.br/servidores/consulta?ordenarPor=nome&direcao=asc), which provides data on public servants in Brazil.

## Gallery for Graphs and Diagrams in R

To visualize data and create various types of graphs and diagrams, I will refer to the [R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/), which offers a wide range of examples and resources for creating high-quality visualizations in R.

## Tools and Resources

I will use various tools and resources throughout the course, including:

- Statistical software such as R or Python for data analysis and visualization.
- The Moodle platform for course material and communication.
- Relevant textbooks and online resources to deepen my understanding of the topics covered.

## Evaluation and Projects

Throughout the semester, I will be completing several assignments and projects, which will be documented in this repository. Each project will have its own folder with a README file explaining its objectives, methods, and results.
